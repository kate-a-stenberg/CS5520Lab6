## Overview

Fireside Chat enables users to send and receive messages in real time. It uses Firebase Realtime Database to persist user information and message history, ensuring a smooth, responsive chatting experience. The design is inspired by industry favorites like Discord and WhatsApp, offering a familiar yet unique user interface.

## UI Design

Our initial UI was designed using Figma. You can view the original design [here](https://www.figma.com/design/XvEocXRQ8t1yMg8vBYBaq7/Lab-6---Firebase-powered-Chat-App?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=efmqMEgxFF4ueHVO-0).  
However, as the project evolved, our design went a bit off track and we made several modifications to better suit our needs.
